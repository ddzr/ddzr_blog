      <description>IntroThis would be lists of things related to data.table that I found useful. I realized there’re certain tasks I want to do in data.table that I keep forgetting and have to google it. After multiple times of repetition, I’m just getting tired of it and decide to document some tips/tricks I found useful.
These tricks could be dangerous workaround as I’m newbie to R/data.table. Sometimes I only know this would work but don’t know why it would work.</description>
